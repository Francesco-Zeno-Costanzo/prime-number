# prime-number
The first code calculates the first prime numbers smaller than a given N and returns the graph of the enumerative function and its two main approximations;
the second is a small implementation of the Goldbach conjecture.

The RSA method is an asymmetric public key cryptographic algorithm.
The user must independently generate two keys: one public and accessible to all that can be used by another user to encrypt the message to be sent, a private one known only by the user which is used to decrypt the message received.
